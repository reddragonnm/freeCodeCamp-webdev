          <h2>Theory of Relativity</h2>

          <p>
            The theory of special relativity was published by Einstein in 1905, in the paper On the Electrodynamics of
            Moving
            Bodies. It says that both distance measurements and time measurements change near the speed of light. This
            means that as
            one get closer to the speed of light (nearly 300,000 kilometres per second), lengths appear to get
            shorter, and clocks
            tick more slowly. Einstein said that special relativity is based on two ideas. The first is that the laws
            of physics are
            the same for all observers that are not moving in relation to each other.

            The theory is based on two postulates:
            <br>
            <br>
            - The laws of physics are invariant (that is, identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is,
            frames of reference
            with no acceleration).

            <br>
            - The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source
            or observer.

          <h2>Mass - Energy Equivalence</h2>

          <p>
            E=mc2, also called the mass-energy equivalence, is one of the things that Einstein is most famous for. It is
            a famous
            equation in physics and math that shows what happens when mass changes to energy or energy changes to mass.
            The "E" in
            the equation stands for energy. Energy is a number which you give to objects depending on how much they can
            change other
            things. For instance, a brick hanging over an egg can put enough energy onto the egg to break it. A feather
            hanging over
            an egg does not have enough energy to hurt the egg.
            nergy can also be transformed into mass. If you were pushing a baby buggy at a slow walk and found it easy
            to push, but
            pushed it at a fast walk and found it harder to move, then you would wonder what was wrong with the baby
            buggy. Then if
            you tried to run and found that moving the buggy at any faster speed was like pushing against a brick wall,
            you would be
            very surprised. The truth is that when something is moved then its mass is increased. Human beings
            ordinarily do not
            notice this increase in mass because at the speed humans ordinarily move the increase in mass in almost
            nothing.

          <h2>BEC</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of a Bose-Einstein condensate came out of a collaboration between S. N. Bose and Prof. Einstein.
            Einstein
            himself did not invent it but, instead, refined the idea and helped it become popular.

          <h2>Zero - point energy</h2>
          <p>
            The concept of zero-point energy was developed in Germany by Albert Einstein and Otto Stern in 1913.
